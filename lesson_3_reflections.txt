When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Following are the scenarios when I would want to use a remote repository:
    1. If I am working on a project in a team, it is required to keep the repository at a location where
       everyone in the team can access and contribute to the project. This is only possible with a remote
       repository. If we work on our local repositories features added or changes made by other members 
       will not be reflected in mine and vice versa and everyone will end up having different versions of
       the same project.
    2. If I want to share my work with the public so that they can use it in their projects or learn 
       from my work or even contribute to better my solution/code.
    3. When I want to take a backup of my code. Dropbox or google drive can come handy but Github is 
       specially made for coding and hence the files will be stored in a format where if I loose my
       local repo, I can clone the github repo and use it as I would use normally without any overheads
       of copy pasting anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   I want to pull changes manually from remote repository because, many people can 
   possibly make different changes on different branches on the remote repository.
   That might include the same files I am modifying sometimes, but a different part
   of it. Now, while I am working git suddenly syncs with the newly added/modifed 
   files onto my local repo, everything will become haphazard and un-organized and I 
   may also loose my current code if i have not commited them as the master now has
   changed and the file that I modifying also changed in between. My code may not 
   compile. Only once I am sure with the my code and teh Github repo  changes and
   make sure no unneccasry changes are happening to the project on my local, I will
   want to pull the Github repo.
